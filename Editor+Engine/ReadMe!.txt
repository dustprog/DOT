If you have any questions on how to use DOT, or its editor, feel free to contact the studio at projectferomine@gmail.com

If you wish to join WireZapp, feel free to contact me as well :D

The EXE is located under Editor+Engine/Debug/DOT_Editor

In order to compile DOT, you need the newest version of Qt (As of November 2014) [5.3.2] for Windows.
Both 32 and 64 bit versions are required. A minimum of Visual Studio 2013 is also required for compilation.

Also required:
	-OpenGL
	-JRE (Oddly... Never could figure out why)
-UPDATE YOUR VIDEO DRIVERS!!!! It has a nasty habbit of crashing on older NVIDIA drivers.

-If you are experiencing difficulty on an AMD CPU, particularly the bulldog series, please contact me. We can't solve this bug yet :(


Later versions of DOT will require Visual Studio 2013 Profesional or better, as well as a full
directX 11 installation.

We will not be releasing source code on Linux and Mac OSX versions of DOT. If you want access to these
versions, please contact us at the email provided above.

If you wish to use DOT in a commercial (INDIE!!!) product, please contact me before integrating DOT into your product
(We want to make sure that its integrated well into most if not all solutions).

If you wish to use DOT in a commercial non-indie product, please contact me and we will schedule a meeting.

If you wish to utilize the newest version of DOT (The open source version will always be a minimum of 10 versions behind
our inhouse edition), please contact me to discuss licensing.
